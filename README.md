How do I install yat.sh?
--------------------------

Just `brew tap farfanoide/yatsh` and then `brew install yatsh`. If the
formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew
install farfanoide/yatsh/yatsh`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/farfanoide/homebrew-yatsh/master/yatsh.rb
```
